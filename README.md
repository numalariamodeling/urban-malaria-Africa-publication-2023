Trends in urban malaria and ITN use, access, and cost from 2010- 2021.
The scripts in this repo can be used to analyze the DHS/ MIS to calculate P. falciparum parasite prevalence estimates by cluster for each country in sub-Saharan Africa which collected this data between the years 2010- 2021. Scripts for our research on the factors associated with malaria prevalence in urban areas in sub-Saharan Africa are also included. We also include code for the analysis of the hpothetical scenario where if nets for urban areas were reserved for persons living in urban slums and funds from any excess nets could instead be used to purchase RDTs and ACTs.
